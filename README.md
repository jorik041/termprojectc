### **C# <s>RSA</s> Protected chat** ###

All the current non-stable sources are availible in "mikhail" branch. They should also be availible in "alexey" branch when it would be created. There are also *.exe files in the debug folder to download and run current version without any compiling. 

### What is this repository for? ###

* Repository represents term project that should be made by two BMSTU students to the end of the term. We see it as a peer-to-peer multiuser chat with RSA protection. Full task is availible in master branch in russian (TekhZad.odt)
* Final version would be availible in the master branch when it's done. All stable versions are also availible there.
